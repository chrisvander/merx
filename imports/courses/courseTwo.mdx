<h1>Saving</h1>

**What is the premise of a savings account?**

A bank will hold onto your money for some time. They are allowed to use your money to make more money for the amount of time that it 
is in the bank. The bank is confident enough in their ability to do this, so they other you a reward in the form of interest. A bank 
will give you more money that you put in. So, it's a win-win situation. You make a small percentage of interest off the cash you have 
saved, and the bank gets to use your money to leverage more money while it's in there. There are a few nuances to different types of 
savings accounts that make a big difference in the long run.

**Pre-tax versus Post-tax Savings Account**

With any form of income, you have to pay taxes to the government. Some accounts will allow you to divert money from your paycheck 
before it gets taxed into a savings account. On the contrary, some accounts will only take income that has already been taxed.
However, when you want to cash in on this savings account, the Pre-tax account *still needs to be taxed* The post-tax account doesn't. 
A good example is the Traditional IRA versus the Roth IRA. IRA simply stands for Induvidual Retirement Account. A Traditional IRA is pre-tax 
and a Roth IRA is post-tax. With interest, over time, you would rather pay tax on the smaller intial amount versus the larger amount 
that includes interest.
