**Types of Risk**

Investors confront two main types of risk when investing. The first is **undiversifiable**, which is also known as systematic or market risk. This type of risk is **associated with every company**. Common causes include inflation rates, exchange rates, political instability, war, and interest rates. This type of risk is not specific to a particular company or industry, and it cannot be eliminated or reduced through diversificationâ€”it is just a risk investors must accept.

The second type of risk is **diversifiable**. This risk is also known as unsystematic risk and is **specific to a company, industry, market, economy, or country**. It can be reduced through diversification. The most common sources of unsystematic risk are business risk and financial risk. Thus, the aim is to invest in various assets so they will not all be affected the same way by market events.

**Diversification**

Diversification is a technique that **reduces risk by allocating investments among various financial instruments**, industries, and other categories. It aims to maximize returns by investing in different areas that would each react differently to the same event.

Most investment professionals agree that, although it does not guarantee against loss, diversification is the most important component of reaching long-range financial goals while minimizing risk.

Let's say you have a portfolio of only airline stocks. If it is announced that airline pilots are going on an indefinite strike and that all flights are canceled, share prices of airline stocks will drop. That means your portfolio will experience a noticeable drop in value.

If, however, you **counterbalanced** the airline industry stocks with a couple of railway stocks, only part of your portfolio would be affected. In fact, there is a good chance the railway stock prices would climb, as passengers turn to trains as an alternative form of transportation.

But, you could diversify even further because there are many risks that affect both rail and air because each is involved in transportation. An event that reduces any form of travel hurts both types of companies. Statisticians, for example, would say that rail and air stocks have a strong correlation.

Therefore, you would want to diversify across the board, not only **different types of companies** but also different types of industries. **The more uncorrelated your stocks are, the better**.

It's also important to diversify among different asset classes. Different assets such as bonds and stocks will not react in the same way to adverse events. A **combination of asset classes** will reduce your portfolio's sensitivity to market swings. Generally, bond and equity markets move in opposite directions, so if your portfolio is diversified across both areas, unpleasant movements in one will be offset by positive results in another.

And finally, don't forget **location, location, location**. Diversification also means you should look for investment opportunities beyond your own geographical borders. After all, volatility in the United States may not affect stocks and bonds in Europe, so investing in that part of the world may minimize and offset the risks of investing at home.

Try the tool below - you can add stocks and change how much you invest in each! Your goal should be to minimize your Sharpe ratio (in other words, maximize your return and minimize your volatility).
