# Introduction to Saving

**What is the premise of a savings account?**

A bank will hold onto your money for some time. They are allowed to use your money to make more money for the amount of time that it 
is in the bank. The bank is confident enough in their ability to do this, so they other you a reward in the form of interest. A bank 
will give you more money that you put in. So, it's a win-win situation. You make a small percentage of interest off the cash you have 
saved, and the bank gets to use your money to leverage more money while it's in there.

**Interest: Simple versus Compound**

Imagine you have $5000 in the bank with 10% interest per year. Using the formula *($ amount) x (% interest) / 100 *, one year later you will have $100 in interest. 
With simple interest, to the amount earned from interest is only based on the initial deposit. That means every year you will gain $100. With compound interest, 
you add the interest back into the acccount and determine next year's interest off of that number. So year two you'll make 10% of $1100 dollars. This slight 
difference actually makes a huge difference over time.

**Importance of Saving Early**

If you're familiar with your math terms, simple interest (with no additional payments) models as a linear curve and the compound models as an exponential. 
However with any savings account, you shouldn't make one inital deposit and let it sit, but rather contribute small amounts over time. Even better, you 
setup a budget and allocate money every month to your savings. A good rule of thumb is that 20% of your income after tax should go towards saving and paying off debts. 

For example; if you make $50,000 per year after tax, following the rule of thumb this $20,000 per year. Let's say that $10,000 is going into your retirement account per year. 
For this type of account, a 7% interest rate is reasonable. Let's also assume that you found **merx** so you were savvy enough to start investing at 25. If you retire at 65,
that gives us ***40 years*** of compound interest. Let's also setup a second senario where you don't start investing until you're 30 and still withdraw at 65. 
Here's what that looks like

**Holy cow 3 million dollars!!**

And those 5 years of delay that saved you $50,000 in the short term, ended up costing you $1,000,000 from your retirement. Now there are a lot of assumptions made but the 
numbers used are attainable. The takeaway here should be that you *need* to start saving early. One of the most valuable things you can leverage is time.
