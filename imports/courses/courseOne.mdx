# This is our course

Here are some questions that we hope to answer for you:
- *What do I do with my money?*
- *How do I save?*
- *How do I invest?*
- *How do I pay off my debts?*

---

There are a few different types of saving accounts. We will go over some of the more common types. 
These are:
- 401k
- Roth IRA
- Traditional IRA
They each have their advantages and drawbacks, so you need to know which one to use and when.

You could also invest your money. It is riskier but also has a higher reward. There are four primary types of investment.
- Stocks
- Bonds
- Commodities
- Real Estate
What are the differences betweem each? Which one is right for you?
